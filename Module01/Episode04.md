# Consumption-based model

- no upfront costs
- no wasted resources
- pay for what you need
- stop paying any time

## Example: charging for VM:
- paying for:
    - compute power
    - network
    - storage
    - or if you are using any other service you pay for that service
- multiple pricing comonents per service
- very granular usage measurement

- the consumption-based model is a pricing model used in the cloud so that customers are only charged **based on their resource usage**
