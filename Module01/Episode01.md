# Episode 01: Cloud computing, High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery

- skills learned: 
    - Describe what is Cloud Computing
    - Describe terms such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery

## Cloud Computing:
- delivery model for services like: 
    - storage
    - computer power
    - networking
    - analytics
    - and mutch more services...
    - delivering all this over the internet

## Cloud key characteristics:
- Scalability:
    - is the ability to scale
    - process of allocating (adding) or
    - deallocating (removing) resources
    - CPU, memory, storage...

- Elasticity:
    - is the ability to scale dynamically
    - automatic scaling is basically what elasticity is

- agility:
    - is the ability to react quickly
    - ability to allocate and deallocate (scale) resources quickly

- Fault Tolerance:
    - is the ability to remain up and running during component and service failures

<img src="..\Images\faultTolerance.png" alt="faultTolerance.png" />

- Disaster Recovery:
    - disaster is a serious disruption of services caused by natural or human-induced causes
    - earth quake, power problem
    - disaster recovery is the ability to revocer from an event that has taked down the service

- High Availability:
    - availability is a measure of system uptime for users/services
    - HA is the ability to keep services running for extended periods of time with very little downtime

## Summary: 
### Cloud Computing

Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is
not limited to

-   **compute power** meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting
    environments, etc.

-   **storage** like files and/or databases

-   **networking** in azure but also outside when connecting to your
    company network

-   **analytics** services for visualization and telemetry data

## Key concepts

-   **scalability** is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate
    resources at any time

-   **elasticity** is the ability to scale dynamically

-   **agility** is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)

-   **fault tolerance** is the ability to maintain system uptime while
    physical and service component failures happen

-   **disaster recovery** is the process and design principle which
    allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters

-   **high availability** is the agreed level of operational uptime for
    the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole
    lifetime of the system.

    -   availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)
